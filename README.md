## Calculation Formulas

### Basic Pay
- Semi-monthly Rate = Monthly Salary ÷ 2

### Deductions
- Late Deduction = (Hourly Rate ÷ 60) × Late Minutes
- Undertime Deduction = (Hourly Rate ÷ 60) × Undertime Minutes
- Absence Deduction = Daily Rate × Absent Days

### Tax Calculation
Withholding tax uses progressive tax rates according to Philippine tax brackets:
- Up to ₱20,833: 0%
- Over ₱20,833 to ₱33,332: 20% of excess over ₱20,833
- Over ₱33,332 to ₱66,666: ₱2,500 + 25% of excess over ₱33,333
- Over ₱66,666 to ₱166,666: ₱10,833 + 30% of excess over ₱66,667
- Over ₱166,666 to ₱666,666: ₱40,833.33 + 32% of excess over ₱166,667
- Over ₱666,666: ₱200,833.33 + 35% of excess over ₱666,667
